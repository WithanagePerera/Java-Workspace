// Generates a shortest path
// Maintains 2 sets:
// 1 set contains verticies includde in the shortest path
// 1 set contains verticies not yet included/checked
// Assign the verticies values representing the number of steps from the origin
// This node value updates as you try each path
// Ultimately stops when you've reached the smallest node value
